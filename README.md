- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

how to edit, manipulate svg, and make it user friendly .

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flexbox;
  font-family: "Public Sans", sans-serif;
  color: var(--Grayish-Blue);
  width: fit-content;
  --Dark-Blue: hsl(233, 26%, 24%);
  --Lime-Green: hsl(136, 65%, 51%);
  --Bright-Cyan: hsl(192, 70%, 51%);
  --Grayish-Blue: hsl(233, 8%, 62%);
  --Light-Grayish-Blue: hsl(220, 16%, 96%);
  --Very-Light-Gray: hsl(0, 0%, 98%);
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

next step after this project is to practice more user friendly designs with adding in functionality with javaScript
